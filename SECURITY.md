# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The most recent major version of react-bootstrap4-modal is supported with security updates.  For example, if the current version of the package is 1.3.2,
and we receive a vulnerability report and fix it, we will release version 1.3.3.  Because we use semantic versioning, it should always be safe for users
of any 1.x version to update to this release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use Tidelift for coordinated vulnerability disclosure. To report vulnerabilities, go to https://tidelift.com/security.
